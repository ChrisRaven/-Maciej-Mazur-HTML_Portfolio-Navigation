				<p class="project-description">Simulate operations on a music playlist. 2 initial default albums are "built-in" the album storage during class Player constructor processing to make it easier for a user<span class="dots">...</span><span class="more"> to simulate traversing the playlist without having to add/create some new songs first. Class Player based on 2 LinkedLists for playlist and for albums storage. ListIterator was used to move through the playlist. User is asked to provide action choices in an infinite loop. Various actions (20) are available, related to adding songs/albums (e.g. creating albums, adding specific songs or whole albums to the playlist), "playing" the playlist (all the playlist from the beginning or a specific song chosen by a track number, playing the last played song, the next and/or previous song), printing songs in playlist, songs in a specific album or in all albums (several types of print available), searching for specific songs in playlist and/or in stored albums. You can also search for a specific song in all the album store in case you suspect a given song might have re-occurred in 1 or more albums. Inner class PairNumberSong was created to identify the number of the album and the position number in a given album when searching for one song in more than one album. You can delete a song from playlist by its title or by its track number. The code is guarded from repeating playing the same song when changing the direction of traversal through the playlist, also from the attempt to move outside of the range of the playlist when any of its ends is reached or from entering a non-numeric value as a track choice; also from duplicating albums in  the album store. Separate method songNumberChoice() was used to properly process user's choice of the song number. Constituent package private classes Song and Album were used to build a main class Player. JAR archive was created. Object class toString() was overriden.</span><span class="expand-collapse">Read more</span></p>

				"Write a method named canPack with three parameters of type int named bigCount, smallCount, and goal.<br>
				The parameter bigCount represents the count of big flour bags (5 kilos each). The parameter smallCount represents the count of small flour bags (1 kilo each). The parameter goal represents the goal amount of kilos of flour needed to assemble a package. Therefore, the sum of the kilos of bigCount and smallCount must be at least equal to the value of goal. The method should return true if it is possible to make a package with goal kilos of flour. If the sum is greater than goal, ensure that only full bags are used towards the goal amount. <br><br>
				For example, if goal = 9, bigCount = 2, and smallCount = 0, the method should return false since each big bag is 5 kilos and cannot be divided. However, if goal = 9, bigCount = 1, and smallCount = 5, the method should return true because of 1 full bigCount bag and 4 full smallCount bags equal goal, and it's okay if there are additional bags left over.<br><br>

Whenever you change direction of your travel the code protects you from visiting the last visited city again (instead the actual previously visited city will be displayed in the message). Also, whenever you reach any of the list's ends you will be informed that no further travel in the same direction is possible. Instead, you will be suggested by the program to change the direction of your travel.</span><span class="expand-collapse">Read more</span></p>
